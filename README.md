# Maven Alfresco SDK

[![Maven Alfresco SDK logo](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-sdk/raw/master/src/site/resources/img/alfresco-maven-logo.jpg)](#features)

The Alfresco SDK based on Apache Maven, includes support for rapid and standard development, testing, packaging, versioning and release of your Alfresco integration and extension projects. 

It is composed of:

- An [SDK Parent POM](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/poms/alfresco-sdk-parent/index.html) which you can use in your projects to enable rapid Alfresco development features
- An [Alfresco Platform Distribution POM](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-platform-distribution/latest/index.html) which pre-configures versions of Alfresco and common 3rd party dependency libraries, for stability purposes
- An Alfresco [Maven Plugin](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/index.html) which provides AMP packaging and installation facitilites (a la MMT) and other common goals for Alfresco development
- A number of *Maven Archetypes* (sample projects) including:
	1. [Alfresco Repository AMP Archetype](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/archetypes/alfresco-amp-archetype/index.html)
	2. [Alfresco Share AMP Archetype](#)
	3. [Alfresco All-in-One Archetype](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/archetypes/alfresco-allinone-archetype/index.html)
