# Maven Alfresco SDK
==================

The Alfresco SDK based on Apache Maven, includes support for rapid and standard development, testing, packaging, versioning and release of your Alfresco integration and extension projects. 

It is composed of:

- An SDK Parent POM which you can use in your projects to enable rapid Alfresco development features
- An Alfresco Maven Plugin which provides AMP packaging and installation facitilites (a la MMT) and other common goals for Alfresco development
- A number of Maven Archetypes (sample projects) including:
	1. Alfresco Repository AMP Archetype
	2. Alfresco Share AMP Archetype
	3. Alfresco All-in-One Archetype

Full documentation is available at the [Maven Alfresco SDK site](https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/index.html).
Additional documentation for Alfresco Community and Enterprise, tutorials and examples is available in the [Alfresco Docs](http://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/concepts/dev-extensions-maven-sdk-intro.html).
