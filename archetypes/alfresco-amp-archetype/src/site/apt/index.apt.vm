How to create a project:

  As of version 2.0-beta-3, you can create a project with the latest released archetype with the following command directly from Maven Central:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  For previous versions, you need to use the Alfresco Artifacts repository:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  You should then:
  
  [[1]] Select the <<<alfresco-amp-archetype>>> option
  
  [[2]] Specify the <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>> for the project you want to create
  
  [[3]] (<Optionally>) Select Alfresco Version / Edition (current default is: Alfresco Community 4.2.c)
  
 You can find new Alfresco AMP project ready to go in the <<<artifactId>>> folder.
